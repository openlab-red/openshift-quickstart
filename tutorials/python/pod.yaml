# The container uses the 'registry.redhat.io/ubi9/python-312' image.
# It exposes port 8000 and runs a Python HTTP server using the command ["python3", "-m", "http.server"].
# Resource limits and requests are set to ensure the container uses a maximum of 0.5 CPU units and 512Mi of memory,
# while requesting at least 0.2 CPU units and 256Mi of memory.
# A liveness probe is configured to check the health of the container by sending HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/') on port 8000.
# The probe starts 3 seconds after the container starts and runs every 3 seconds.
