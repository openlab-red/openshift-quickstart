# This YAML configuration defines an OpenShift Route resource.
# A Route exposes a service at a hostname so external clients can reach it.
# 
# The Route is named 'python-server-route' and points to a Service named 'python-server-service'.
# It routes external traffic to port 8000 of the service.
# The weight of 100 means all traffic goes to this service (useful for A/B deployments).
# wildcardPolicy: None means this Route does not accept wildcard subdomain requests.
