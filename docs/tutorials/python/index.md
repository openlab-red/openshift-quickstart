# Deploying and Testing a Python server

## Tutorial

> The code examples and instructions in this tutorial are located under `openshift-quickstart` project in the
> `tutorials/python` directory. 
> Ensure you are in this directory before executing the commands.
>

1. Navigate to the Tutorial Directory
    ```bash
    # Change to the tutorials/simple directory
    cd openshift-quickstart/tutorials/python
    ```

2. Or open a New Terminal

### Building the Container Image

1. **Build the Container Image:**
   Use the following command to build the container image for the Python server:
   ```bash
   podman build -t python-server:latest .
   ```

### Running the Container

2. **Run the Container:**
   Start the container using the image you just built:
   ```bash
   podman run python-server:latest
   ```

3. **Verify the Container is Running:**
   Check the status of the running container with:
   ```bash
   podman ps
   ```

### Testing the Server

1. **Test the Server:**
   Ensure the server is responding by executing:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000
   ```
   > Note: This command will fail at this point since we haven't mapped the container's port to the host yet. We'll fix this in the next step.

2. **Relaunch the Container with Port Mapping:**
   To map the container's port to the host, use:
   ```bash
   podman run -p8000:8000 python-server:latest
   ```

3. **Test the Server Again:**
   Verify the server is accessible with:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Deploying with Podman

1. **Create a Pod:**
   Deploy the application as a pod with port publishing:
   ```bash
   podman play kube --publish 8000:8000 pod.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify Pod is Running:**
   Check the status of the pod and its containers:
   ```bash
   podman pod ps
   podman ps
   ```

3. **Stop and Remove the Pod:**
   To stop and remove the pod, use:
   ```bash
   podman pod stop <podId>
   podman pod rm <podId>
   ```

### Deploying to OpenShift

1. **Create Resources in OpenShift:**
    Switch to the desired project and create resources:
    ```bash
    # Note: If you are using DevSpaces, you are already logged in your namespace due to token injection
    # For non-DevSpaces users:
    # oc login --token=<your-token> --server=<your-server-url>
    # oc project devspaces-userX

    oc create -f pod.yaml
    ```

2. **Add Service and Route:**
    Expose the application by creating a service and route:
    ```bash
    oc create -f service.yaml
    oc create -f route.yaml
    ```
3. **Access the Application:**
    Get the route URL and access your application:
    ```bash
    # Get the route URL
    oc get route python-server-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
    
    # Access the application using the route URL
    curl http://$(oc get route python-server-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```
    You can also open the route URL in your web browser to view the application.
    You can find the route URL under "Networking" â†’ "Routes" and click it to access your application.

4. **Note on Pod Deletion:**
    Be aware that deleting the pod will result in the loss of the running instance.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Deployment in OpenShift

**Objective:** Learn how to create a deployment in OpenShift to manage your application.

1. **Create a Deployment:**
   Use the following command to create a deployment for your application:
   ```bash
   oc create deployment python-server --image=registry.redhat.io/ubi9/python-312 -- python3 -m http.server
   ```

2. **Verify the Deployment:**
   Check the status of the deployment to ensure it was created successfully:
   ```bash
   oc get deployments
   ```

3. **Check the Pods:**
   Verify that pods are running as part of the deployment:
   ```bash
   # Note: The pod name will have a random suffix appended to it, like: python-server-5b7f8d9c7b-xyz12
   oc get pods
   ```

### Exercise 2: Scale the Deployment

**Objective:** Understand how to scale a deployment to handle more traffic.

1. **Scale the Deployment:**
   Increase the number of replicas to handle more traffic:
   ```bash
   oc scale --replicas=3 deploy/python-server
   ```

2. **Verify Scaling:**
   Check the status of the pods to ensure scaling was successful:
   ```bash
   oc get pods
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**
   Ensure the application is still accessible and functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   curl http://$(oc get route python-server-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
   ```

### Exercise 3: Update the Deployment with a New Image

**Objective:** Learn how to update a deployment with a new version of your application.

1. **Build a New Image:**
   Make changes to your application and build a new image:
   ```bash
   podman build -t python-server:v2 .
   ```

2. **Import the Local Image to OpenShift:**

   **For Laptop Users:**
   >
   > Note: The OpenShift internal registry has been exposed just for the workshop.
   >

   Use the following command to log in to the OpenShift internal registry:
   ```bash
   podman login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) https://default-route-openshift-image-registry.{{ config.extra.base_url }}
   ```
   Tag your local image with the OpenShift registry namespace:
   ```bash
   podman tag python-server:v2 default-route-openshift-image-registry.{{ config.extra.base_url }}/devspaces-user1/python-server:v2
   ```
   Push the tagged image to the OpenShift internal registry:
   ```bash
   podman push default-route-openshift-image-registry.{{ config.extra.base_url }}/devspaces-user1/python-server:v2
   ```

   **For DevSpaces Users:**

   Use the following command to log in to the OpenShift internal registry:
   ```bash
   podman login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
   ```
   Tag your local image with the OpenShift registry namespace:
   ```bash
   podman tag python-server:v2 image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/devspaces-user1/python-server:v2
   ```
   Push the tagged image to the OpenShift internal registry:
   ```bash
   podman push image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/devspaces-user1/python-server:v2
   ```

3. **Update the Deployment:**
   - Update the deployment to use the new image:
     ```bash
     oc set image deployment/python-server python-312=python-server:v2 --source=imagestreamtag
     ```
     > Note: An imagestream tag in OpenShift is a reference to a specific version of an image within an imagestream. It allows you to manage and track different versions of container images, facilitating seamless updates and rollbacks.

4. **Verify the Update:**
   - Check the status of the deployment to ensure it updated successfully:
     ```bash
     oc rollout status deployment/python-server
     ```

5. **Test the Updated Application:**
   - Verify that the updated application is running correctly:
     ```bash
     curl http://$(oc get route python-server-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
     ```
